announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.
  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.
  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: The vulnerability allows for an attacker to create, modify, or delete files
  using a specially crafted Web Application Resource (WAR) file. Tomcat fails
  to check for directory traversal commands in directory paths using ../ and
  that is what the attacker uses to craft the WAR file.
  When the WAR file is deployed on the Tomcat server, the directory traversal
  command can be used to modify files outside of the web root directory. The 
  files can be created, modified, or deleted. 
  Secure information from the web server could be moved out of sccope, or a key
  file for the server could be deleted which could cause a denial of service.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?
    Write the reasoning behind your answer in the "answer" field.
    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module. Must be just "true" or "false".
    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
    Must be just "true" or "false".
  answer: false
  code: false

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?
    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found.
    * Answer in longform below in "answer"
    * Fill in the date in YYYY-MM-DD
    * If it's clear that the vulnerability was discovered by a contest,
      fill in the name there.
    * The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you
    may leave the entries blank except for "answer", BUT please write down
    where you looked in "answer".
  answer: The SVN page for the commit does not indicate how the vulnerability was found
    https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomcat/trunk@892795
    and the links within the CVE page also do not show how this was discovered
    https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2693
  date: 2009-07-30
  automated: false
  contest: 

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?
    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
    Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: startup
  name: startup

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?
    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this
    section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer:
  commits:
    - commit: 3b0ea850738c091299373a330929cc024dd1867a
      note: There isn't anything interesting happening. But this commit reverted the
        previous commit since the developer was not satisfied with the fix. 

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?
    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.
    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.
    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?
    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?
    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: The mistake that was made here was simple. The developer neglected to consider
    that someone might try to navigate outside of the root directory and never
    put in test cases and exceptions for when that happens. Since there was a lack
    of unit testing, the directory traversal was never tested for and stayed in the 
    code for a while unnoticed. This isn't exactly a mistake but more of an oversight 
    on the developers part. The vulnerability was fixed by adding checks for "../" 
    for any path that was being constructed.
