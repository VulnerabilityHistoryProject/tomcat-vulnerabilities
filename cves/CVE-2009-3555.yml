CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE entry
  that describes your vulnerability. (Tip: this may not be a good one to start
  with - spend time understanding this vulnerability before making your choice!)
CWE: 300 Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint

curated_instructions: |
  If you are manually editing this file, then you are "curating" it. Set the
  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everything out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.

  Was there a date that this vulnerability was reported to the team? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE data.
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
reported: 2009-10-05

announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE data.
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
announced: 2009-11-09

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.
  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.
  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  Earlier protocols do not properly associate renegotiation handshakes.  
  Handshakes are the automated processing of negotiation between two participants 
  through the exchange of information that establishes communication.  This can allow
  for potential "man-in-the-middle" attacks.  An attacker can slip into the middle of 
  the two communicators and inject unauthorized requests that will be automatically 
  processed by the server and renegotiated into authorized requests.  The attacker 
  will not only be able to see communications between the two parties, but also 
  impersonate each endpoint and gain access to the user's activity, data, etc.

    note: |
      SVN rev 297994, from the Tomcat website.  It is funny because the log message
      indicates that it is a refactoring and should not harm anything and make stuff
      easier, yet it introduces a potential security flaw.  This is where all of the 
      jsse files were added to the project.

incomplete_fix_instructions: |
  Did the above "fixes" actually fix the vulnerability?
  Please list any fix commits for this vulnerability that had to be corrected
  at a later date.
incomplete_fixes:
  - commit: c5e5a4f0e8d22c5419a7f10d4ccf8f8adc27ee51
    note: |
      This commit just introduced a workaround for the security risk,
      thus is not a complete fix.  All it did was provide an option to disable 
      legacy SSL renegotiation.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?
    Write the reasoning behind your answer in the "answer" field.
    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module. Must be just "true" or "false".
    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
    Must be just "true" or "false".
  answer: No automated unit tests were found
  code: false
  fix: false

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?
    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found.
    * Answer in longform below in "answer"
    * Fill in the date in YYYY-MM-DD
    * If it's clear that the vulnerability was discovered by a contest,
      fill in the name there.
    * The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you
    may leave the entries blank except for "answer", BUT please write down
    where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    The information here is not entirely clear, but it seems as if 
    someone wrote code to include an SSL renegotiation to request a client 
    certificate from the browser when a webapp required an SSL connection with a
    client certificate.  Another user mentioned after that there is no 
    <auth-constraint> in the configuration and when it was fixed for 
    the initial negotiation, the first user noticed that no certificate was 
    asked for in the renegotiation.
  date: 20009-04-01
  automated: nil
  contest: false

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?
    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
    Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE)
  name: jsse

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?
    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this
    section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer:
  commits:
    - commit: 359c7ee17f5759cc99988e1cc9e971fe4a6ffad5
      note: They completely disabled all renegotiations to avoid this issue entirely.
    - commit: c5e5a4f0e8d22c5419a7f10d4ccf8f8adc27ee51
      note: The commit seemed as if it fixed the problem, but also potentially exposed it again.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?
    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.
    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.
    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?
    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?
    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    I believe mistakes were made initially in design.  They didn't design it 
    taking security into mind.  Authenticity is obviously an important factor
    and should have not been overlooked so easily.  If there was proper design,
    maybe the coders would have taken more time to ensure both communication end
    points were secure and authenticated.  Also, testing is a huge portion of this
    because it does not seem as if there were many, if any, tests for this 
    vulnerability.  Automated tests seem like the obvious choice, though a daunting
    task I'm sure.
