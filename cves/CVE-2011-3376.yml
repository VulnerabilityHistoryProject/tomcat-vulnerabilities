CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE entry
  that describes your vulnerability. (Tip: this may not be a good one to start
  with - spend time understanding this vulnerability before making your choice!)
CWE: 284

curated_instructions: |
  If you are manually editing this file, then you are "curating" it. Set the
  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everything out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.

announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE data.

announced: 2011-11-08

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.
  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.
  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  Tomcat includes a component that provides administrative functions for 
  web applications such as deployment, reloading, and starting/stopping an
  application called Manager.  Manager did not restrict untrusted web apps' 
  ability to access its servlets.  This allowed untrusted applications to
  use the functionality of the Manager application to do things like run and
  deploy additional applications without the consent of the server owner.
  This vulnerability is primarily a concern for environments such as shared
  hosting, where clients' web applications are not considered trusted.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?
    Write the reasoning behind your answer in the "answer" field.
    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module. Must be just "true" or "false".
    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
    Must be just "true" or "false".
  answer: |
    The class in question "DefaultInstanceManager" was being unit tested, but
    none of the unit tests involved a scenario that would've triggered this
    vulnerability.  In addition, no additional tests were added to test this
    scenario after the bugfix was implemented.
  code: true
  fix: false

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?
    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found.
    * Answer in longform below in "answer"
    * Fill in the date in YYYY-MM-DD
    * If it's clear that the vulnerability was discovered by a contest,
      fill in the name there.
    * The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you
    may leave the entries blank except for "answer", BUT please write down
    where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    Found by Ate Douma.  No information on vulnerability discovery other than
    attribution of discoverer was found.  The CVE/NIST NVD site, Tomcat 7
    vulnerability announcements page, commit message for bugfix, and various
    third-party security databases (SecurityFocus, Rapid7, FortiGuard) were
    consulted.
  date: 2011-09-27
  automated: false
  contest: false

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?
    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
    Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: |
    Based on classpath of class affected.
  name: core

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?
    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this
    section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.

      note: |
        This commit was interesting because it showed that the class in question,
        DefaultInstanceManager, had problems in the past that needed to
        be addressed relating to bypassing security restrictions.  While in this 
        case it was that code could bypass a Java SecurityManager using some
        API calls and not related to the hosted web apps' trust levels themselves,
        it shows that the security implications of this class' design were not
        fully fleshed out and considered.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?
    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.
    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.
    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    note: |
      The vulnerability was due to the fact that Tomcat applications could
      access protected functionality beyond what was needed to run itself
      and perform legitimate operations.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?
    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?
    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    This vulnerability seems to be ultimately a design flaw in how the affected
    class was designed.  Because it did not include any checks to ensure
    applications access it were trusted, there was no mitigation
    servers administrators could perform to resolve it and users of a shared
    hosting environment could execute arbitrary actions in the Tomcat Manager
    without any impediment.
    
    This fix for this vulnerability appears to work as intended, as the code is
    now creating a trust boundary for access between "trusted" and "untrusted"
    applications by explicitly checking the trust status of web applications.
