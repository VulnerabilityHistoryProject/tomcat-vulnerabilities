CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE entry
  that describes your vulnerability. (Tip: this may not be a good one to start
  with - spend time understanding this vulnerability before making your choice!)
CWE: CWE-255

curated_instructions: |
  If you are manually editing this file, then you are "curating" it. Set the
  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everything out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.
  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.
  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  The Windows installer for Apache Tomcat uses a blank default 
  password for the administrative user, which allows remote attackers to gain privileges easily.
  This is obviously aggergious because it gives anyone admin access without having to
  provide any credentials.

    note: |
      Github user "rmaucher" (still contributing to tomcat projects today) added entire file (res/tomcat.nsi) 
      during commit with message "More release scripts work" on July 12 2006. So it appears this vulnerability was 
      introduced upon file inception.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?
    Write the reasoning behind your answer in the "answer" field.
    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module. Must be just "true" or "false".
    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
    Must be just "true" or "false".
  answer: No, only one file changed for fix, and this didn't involve unit tests.
  code: false
  fix: false

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?
    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found.
    * Answer in longform below in "answer"
    * Fill in the date in YYYY-MM-DD
    * If it's clear that the vulnerability was discovered by a contest,
      fill in the name there.
    * The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you
    may leave the entries blank except for "answer", BUT please write down
    where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    This issue was reported directly to the tomcat users public mailing
    list by David Horheim. Link - 
    https://markmail.org/thread/wfu4nff5chvkb6xp#query:+page:1+mid:bva3jqihjxscatev+state:results. -
    He mentions that while downloading exe version of the installer (specifically not zip or tar.gz)
    it enables the manager application - which leads to the default blank password.
  date: 2009-10-26
  automated: false
  contest:

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?
    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
    Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: Configuration - Nullsoft Installer
  name: res

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?
    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this
    section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: |
    Most of the commits are related to bug fixes with links to the bugs (9 in total). Others pertain to changing
    defaults. The interesting thing here is that the original code written by rmaucher seems to have caused a lot
    of issues. Given, it does seem to be a pretty important config file so that is to be expected.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?
    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.
    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.
    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

      By default, the admin password should at least be specified for some amount of security.
      If a user just clicks through midlessly during installation, the blank password will persist.
      This vulnerability defaulted it to blank. Perhaps this is not the user's main concern. Nonetheless,
      not secure by default.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?
    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?
    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    This appears to have been a design issue. The way the engineers designed the system, this vulnerability
    was inherent. They didn't keep in mind the core security principle of secure by default. It wasn't until 
    someone who was investigating security found this issue 3 years later that it was patched. It even mentioned 
    in the response to the vulnerability report that the system behaved contrary to how it was described in the docs.
    The contrast between actual system behavior and the docs was clear midcommunication within the team.
    The mitigation was to simply modify the default password to not be blank, so this mitigation seems sufficient 
    within the scope of the vulnerability.
